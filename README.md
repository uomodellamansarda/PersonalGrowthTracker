Looking at the different script inside this repository, some still very raw, you can evaluate how my coding style evolved. 

This code is made to analyze Pomodoro Techniques Logs and undersand how well Data Science with Python practice is going. 
Practice could be study, no profit projects, work, even reading a data science book.

The goal is to reach 10.000 hours to be an expert.
It's just a trivial proxy, but gives an idea and a direction and it's enough. 

[The last colab notebook Andrea_Ciufo_Python_Growth](https://github.com/uomodellamansarda/clockworkcsvestimator/blob/master/Andrea_Ciufo_Python_Growth.ipynb) takes as input the link on Google Drive where is located the csv file, and then it starts filtering and processing the data.






In the oldest script you can find also the forecasts based on three estimator on the remaining time to become an expert:

-Markov's Inequality 

-Linear regression (I know that variables are not indipendently and identically distributed)

-Non Linear Regression using Prophet, an open source library developed by Facebook
