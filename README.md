# clockworkcsvestimator #quantifiedself #pomodorotechnique 
This code is made to analyze Pomodoro Techniques Logs and undersand how well Data Science with Python practice is going. 
Practice could be study, no profit projects, work, even reading a data science book.

The goal is to reach 10.000 hours to be an expert.
It's just a trivial proxy, but gives an idea and a direction and it's enough. 

The colab notebook takes as input the link on Google Drive where is located the csv file, and then it starts filtering and processing the data.

The code also compares the efforts with a 3h daily ideal and costant practice. 

At the end of the code, after analyzed the past data as a report and feedback session, I made three estimation about the remaining time to become an expert based on:

-Markov Inequality 

-Linear regression (I know that variables are not indipendently and identically distributed)

-Non Linear Regression using Prophet, an open source library developed by Facebook
